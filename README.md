IRCCat Notification Resource
===================================

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/haiku/irccat-resource.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/haiku/irccat-resource)

This Concourse resource reaches out to a remote server [running irccat](https://github.com/irccloud/irccat) to send build
notifications to IRC channels.

Leveraging a service like irccat from concourse allows:

  * A notification bot to idle in IRC channels (reducing spammy joins/quits)
  * Color IRC messages
